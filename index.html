        With one swing of a bat, Tampa Bay Rays centerfielder Brett Phillips made the seemingly “uneven” even, again.

The 27-year-old everyday player with a league-minimum salary of $545,000 per year smacked a game-winning, series-tying base hit against an All-Star relief pitcher in Kenley Jansen, whose $10 million salary was 18 times bigger than Philllips’.

Sure, his Tampa Bay Rays ended up losing the next two games to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2020 Word Series. But for an organization whose $28.2 million payroll was dwarfed by the eventual champions’ $107.9 million payroll, it suggested something.

Perhaps, money isn’t everything.

But is it something?

        Unlike the National Football League and National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, does not operate under a salary cap that forbids teams from spending an unlimited amount of its hard-earned money on players.

The lack of a hard cap is extremely beneficial for ball clubs like the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, and Boston Red Sox — whose status as large-market ball clubs create more lucrative opportunities to generate revenue than smaller-market clubs in cities like Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, and Tampa Bay. 

But in the spirit of maintaining competitive balance, MLB does use something called a “Competitive Balance Tax” that places a tax on teams who spend over the predetermined threshold established on a yearly basis. 

The terms of this Competitive Balance Tax, commonly referred to as the “luxury tax,” penalize repeat offenders at an increasingly higher percentage with each passing year up to the third year, where teams exceeding the threshold would be taxed at a maximum 50 percent tax on all overages.  

Data gathered from SpoTrac (a website dedicated entirely to breaking down salaries and payrolls across professional sports) shows a general correlation between high payrolls and the various metrics used to determine success on the baseball field:

</script>

        •	In the 10 MLB seasons (from 2011 to 2020), 23 teams had a payroll above the luxury tax threshold. Fifteen of those 23 teams made the playoffs.

•	In the past 10 MLB seasons (from 2011 to 2020), the team with the highest payroll in the league made the playoffs nine out of 10 times.
        
        
        In a 162-game season, 90 games is typically enough to secure a playoff spot. In the 10-year span from 2010 to 2019, MLB teams above the luxury tax threshold averaged to win above 90 games.

While the graphic above demonstrates a relationship between regular season wins and payroll over a 10-year span, the correlation becomes less apparent when examining the top five spenders in a given season:

•	Of the 50 teams with a top five payroll in the past 10 seasons, only 26 of them made the playoffs.

Furthermore, recent history shows us that teams with higher payrolls have not been guaranteed to walk through its lesser-paid competition on their way to a World Series – and for some teams, it’s not even a guarantee that money results in a playoff appearance.

For starters, a $229.1 million payroll gave the Boston Red Sox MLB’s most expensive roster in 2019. But despite their lucrative salaries, the team was unable to even make it to the postseason.

“The game is played on dirt and grass, not paper,” said Ethan Cadeaux, a writer for NBC Sports Washington who covered the Washington Nationals during their unlikely 2019 World Series run.

Struggling out of the gate with a 19-31 start, the 2019 Washington Nationals didn’t have the look of a playoff team early on like the Dodgers did with their 32-18 start. While Washington’s slow start made winning the National League East division insurmountable, Cadeaux said things started to turn around for them in the back half of the 162-game regular season as the team’s expectations decreased.

“With lower expectations they played looser, and so from the summer until the end of the season, it was a more relaxed approach to the game,” Cadeaux said. “All that makes you a dangerous team. So once they earned a Wild Card spot, it felt as if they were playing with house money.” 

Speaking of money: the luxury tax threshold in 2019 was predetermined to be $206 million. With a payroll of $172.3 million, the Nationals were only using 83.64 percent of that predetermined threshold. Comparatively, the Dodgers’ payroll of $207 million was just enough to keep them as repeat offenders above the threshold for a seventh consecutive year with a steep 50% tax on all overages.

Despite all of that, Cadeaux believes that Washington’s come-from-behind win in the team’s do-or-die Wild Card game against the Milwaukee Brewers gave them momentum heading into a best-of-five NLDS matchup against a juggernaut Dodgers team that won an NL-best 106 games in the regular season.

“Come October, nobody wants to play that team that’s peaking at the right time,” Cadeaux said. “That’s exactly what the Nats had going for them. Once they beat the Dodgers, it was a big exhale that the club got the monkey off its back that they can’t win in the postseason.  Several excellent starts from (Stephen) Strasburg, timely hitting from veterans like (Howie) Kendrick and (Adam) Eaton, and the right amount of luck gave them a championship formula.”

Additionally, there are other rules that MLB teams can exploit to find success on the field, and according to Will Britt and Rich Aude, it’s done in a perfectly legal way that exploits their players’ earning potential and limits their spending.

As marketing director for The Cut Agency, Britt holds relationships with over 30 Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball players. Plenty of the guys he represents have mentioned how frustrated they are that their ability to earn money can be controlled by the competitive level (Minor Leagues, Majors Leagues) at which an organization chooses to put the player.

Britt says that this method, widely known as “service time manipulation”, is one workaround that organizations use to prolong their control of low paying, team-friendly contracts that help clubs avoid expensive luxury tax penalties for as long as possible. 

Under Article XX of MLB’s collective bargaining agreement, a player can’t become a free agent until he has accumulated six full years of service time in the Majors. Under Article XXI, a “full year” is defined as 172 or more days of a player being on a team’s active roster (or injured list.)

“Teams brimming with high-end prospects who are on the cusp of getting paid can win without spending an exorbitant amount on its players’ salaries,” Britt said. “It sucks for the players, but it’s how teams get the most out of their young guys before making a decision on whether to pay them upwards of $200+ million.”

Aude, a baseball agent who doubles as Senior Director at Wasserman agency, has seen this particular issue from all sides. Before making a career for himself representing players, he was a player himself — playing first base with the small-market Pittsburgh Pirates from 1993 to 1996.

“Small market teams have very smart people running their team,” Aude said. “They use heavy analytics, draft, and develop well. They’ve been able to identify bubble or fringe-type players from other teams and turn them into regulars.”

While MLB’s luxury tax threshold exists under the spirit of discouraging repeat offenders from stacking their roster, no such luxury tax exists for an organization in regard to what they spend on non-players in the organization. In other words, teams can spend as much as they want on hiring and retaining team employees such as coaches, executives, and scouts. 

According to Andy McCullough, a senior MLB writer with The Athletic, this is one way MLB teams are able to find additional success. “Spending on infrastructure and staffing is important, and plenty of organizations like the Dodgers, Giants, Red Sox, Yankees and others do so,” McCullough said in an e-mail interview.

But while McCullough acknowledged this, he made sure to point out that player salaries are in fact a larger factor of team success.

“[Spending on infrastructure and staffing] is a relative pittance compared to what teams spend on player salary,” McCullough said. “The largest expenditure for every single organization is player salary. If teams want to save money, they spend less on players. You can do a lot for your organization by hiring good scouts and good analysts. But I'd rather have Mookie Betts.”
